# CodestralHackathon
CodeBlast Dream CatcherÂ proposes an alternative approach to searching multidimensional space for knowledge.

The CodeBlast Dream Catcher proposes an innovative approach to searching multidimensional space for knowledge based on eight principles:

1. An "all possible combinations space" exists in a multidimensional space where knowledge is discovered, not created.
2. This multidimensional space is best searched with LLMs using goals, as goals carry the recipes for accomplishing them.
3. There exists a multidimensional "all possible" Codestral goal space consisting of interconnected goals resembling a graph.
4. This multidimensional goals space can best be searched by remapping it to the 2D Infinite Canvas proposed in the LabLab.ai Build Your Business StartUp Hackathon's "Navigating the Infinite Plane".
5. The infinite canvas can be created using a 50256 base number system derived from the GPT-2 tokenization labels.
6. To avoid the costly computational expense of base number conversion, hidden and unhidden states are created in the 2D infinite plane.
7. These hidden and unhidden states correspond to the conscious and unconscious mind, proposing that the human brain uses a similar mechanism to avoid the heavy cost of base number conversion.
8. Thus, searching for knowledge becomes a simple mapping problem in 2D and 1D space in both hidden and unhidden states.
